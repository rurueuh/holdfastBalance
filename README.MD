## balance system holdfast

hello i want to build a balance system holdfast with speciality

i'm using cpp because i'm a cpp programmer :p

you just need to create a input.txt with this format

warning with a lot of team the program can be long a safe method is on you can't go more that 500 000 possibles matchs see code if you want to remove it

```
name_regiment,number_of_player,arty,skirm,cav,mountedInfantry,nbOldReg
```

```
name_regiment is the name of the regiment : string
number_of_player is the number of player in the regiment : int
arty is the number of arty in the regiment : bool (0 if no arty) (1 for want arty)
skirm is the number of skirm in the regiment : bool (0 if no skirm) (1 for want skirm)

mounted infantry is the number of mounted infantry in the regiment : bool (0 if no mounted infantry) (1 for want mounted infantry)
